      <h2>Who's Frank Ocean</h2>
      <p>
        Frank Ocean is one of the most influential and acclaimed artists of the
        21st century. Known for his introspective songwriting, unconventional
        production, and elusive public persona, he has redefined contemporary
        R&B and pop music. Unlike many modern celebrities, Ocean rarely gives
        interviews or uses social media, letting his art speak for itself. He is
        a master of storytelling, blending personal heartbreak with abstract
        imagery to create music that feels both intimate and universal.

      <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Born Christopher Edwin Breaux on October 28, 1987, in Long Beach,
          California,[8] to Calvin Cooksey, a singer and keyboardist, and
          Katonya Breaux Riley, an entrepreneur. His parents divorced when he
          was six years old, and he was raised by his mother.[8] At age five,
          his family moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. Ocean was raised Christian
          and spent a brief period as a practicing Catholic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ocean's maternal grandfather Lionel McGruder Jr. was a father figure
          for Ocean after his father left the family. Lionel was a recovering
          drug addict and later served as a mentor at Alcoholics Anonymous and
          Narcotics Anonymous meetings. He would take Ocean to these meetings,
          which was the inspiration behind Ocean's song "Crack Rock" from
          Channel Orange. He also gave him the nickname Lonny, which Frank Ocean
          still uses today. He died in 2010 and Frank Ocean dedicated a song to
          him called "There Will Be Tears" on his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra. He
          also mentioned him on his 2017 single "Lens".
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating from John Ehret High School in Marrero, Louisiana in
          2005, Ocean enrolled in the University of New Orleans to study
          English. However, Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in August 2005,
          destroying his home and personal recording facility and forcing him to
          transfer to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He stayed there
          for a brief time before dropping out to focus on his music career.

    <section id="Career beginnings">
      <h2>Career beginnings</h2>
      <p>
        In 2006, Ocean moved to Los Angeles to pursue his music career, working
        at various fast-food and service jobs to support himself. In less than
        three years, he established himself as a songwriter under the name Lonny
        Breaux. After getting a songwriting deal, Ocean wrote songs for artists
        including Justin Bieber, Beyoncé, John Legend, and Brandy. Ocean later
        said of his work at the time, "There was a point where I was composing
        for other people, and it might have been comfy to continue to do that
        and enjoy that income stream and the anonymity. But that's not why I
        moved away from school and away from family."
      </p>
      <p>
        He adopted the stage name Frank Ocean, getting the name from Frank
        Sinatra and the 1960s film Ocean's 11, which Sinatra starred in. Soon
        after, he joined Los Angeles-based hip hop collective Odd Future, whom
        he had met in 2009. His friendship with Odd Future member Tyler, the
        Creator reinvigorated Ocean's songwriting. In late 2009, he met Tricky
        Stewart, who helped him sign a writing contract with Def Jam Recordings.
        Ocean felt neglected by the label, and began working on a mixtape on his
        own without their input. On February 16, 2011, Ocean self-released the
        resulting mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra online for free. The mixtape
        received critical acclaim. The mixtape focuses on interpersonal
        relationships, personal reflection and social commentary. NPR's Andrew
        Noz said Ocean's songwriting is "smart and subtle...setting him apart
        from the pack". Rolling Stone magazine's Jonah Weiner wrote that Ocean
        was a "gifted avant-R&B smoothie".
      </p>
      <p>
        In April 2011, Ocean stated that his relationship with Def Jam had
        strengthened since the release of the Nostalgia, Ultra. The mixtape made
        Ocean widely known and led to his collaborations with rappers Jay-Z and
        Kanye West. Ocean first appeared in Tyler, the Creator's music video for
        the single "She", from Tyler's second studio album Goblin (2011). His
        first performance was in collaboration with Odd Future at the 2011
        Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where he later joined them for
        their first tour across the east coast of the United States.[33] On May
        19, 2011, Ocean's record label Def Jam announced its plans to re-release
        Nostalgia, Ultra as an EP. The single "Novacane" was released to iTunes
        in May 2011, and the EP originally was set to be released the next
        month, but was delayed.[
      </p>
      <p>
        In June 2011, Ocean revealed that he would work on the upcoming Kanye
        West and Jay-Z collaborative album, Watch the Throne. Ocean co-wrote and
        featured on two tracks: "No Church in the Wild" and "Made in America".
        On July 28, 2011, a song titled "Thinkin Bout You", leaked on the
        internet. It was later revealed the song was a reference track, written
        by Ocean, for Roc Nation artist Bridget Kelly's debut studio album.
        Kelly renamed the song 'Thinking About Forever'. In September 2011, a
        music video directed by High5Collective for Ocean's version was
        released, yet the song still appeared on Kelly's debut EP Every Girl. In
        August 2011, Frank Ocean made his first appearance on the cover of the
        publication The Fader, in its 75th issue.

      <h2>New Superstar</h2>
      <h3>Channel Orange's Era</h3>
      <p>
        Frank Ocean was a name knew by a few people and then he dropped Channel
        Orange
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2012, Ocean released his debut studio album Channel Orange to
        universal acclaim from critics, who later named it the best album of the
        year in the HMV's Poll of Polls. It also earned Ocean six Grammy Award
        nominations and was credited by some writers for moving the R&B genre in
        a different, more challenging direction. Considered as Ocean's first
        commercial release on a traditional record label, Channel Orange
        featured unconventional songs that were noted for their storytelling and
        social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew on jazz, soul,
        and R&B. Funk and electronic music also influenced his album. The songs
        about unrequited love in particular received the most attention, partly
        because of Ocean's announcement prior to the album's release, when he
        revealed that his first love was a man. The announcement made global
        headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when David
        Bowie revealed that he was bisexual in 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
        Channel Orange debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and sold
        131,000 copies in its first week. The majority of its first-week sales
        were digital copies from iTunes, while approximately 3,000 of the sales
        were physical copies. On January 30, Channel Orange was certified gold
        by the RIAA. By September 2014, it had sold 621,000 copies, according to
        Nielsen SoundScan. Ocean promoted the album with his 2012 Summer Tour,
        which featured final appearances at the Coachella and Lollapalooza
        festivals. At the 2013 Brit Awards, Ocean won the Brit Award for
        International Male Solo Artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        On May 28, 2013, Ocean announced the You're Not Dead ... 2013 Tour; a
        fourteen-date European and Canadian tour that began on June 16, 2013, in
        Munich. He had been scheduled to perform at the first night of OVO Fest
        on August 4, 2013; however he was forced to cancel his appearance due to
        a small vocal cord injury. The first night of the music festival was
        subsequently cancelled and James Blake was booked to appear during the
        second night as Ocean's replacement. Ocean appeared on John Mayer's
        album Paradise Valley, as a featured artist on a song called "Wildfire".

      <h2>Eternal Legend</h2>
      <p>
        He was already one of America most beloved artist but the release of
        Blonde took it to another level.
      </p>
      <p>
        In February 2013, Ocean confirmed that he had started work on his second
        studio album, which he confirmed would be another concept album. He
        revealed that he was working with Tyler, the Creator, Pharrell Williams,
        and Danger Mouse on the record.[53] He later stated that he was being
        influenced by The Beach Boys and The Beatles. He stated he was
        interested in collaborating with Tame Impala and King Krule and that he
        would record part of the album in Bora Bora.
      </p>
      <p>
        At midnight Pacific time on August 20, 2016, a music video for a song
        titled "Nikes" was uploaded to Ocean's Connect page on Apple Music and
        later to his own website.[75] Also on August 20, Ocean announced pop-up
        shops in Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, and London for his
        magazine Boys Don't Cry, and released his second studio album Blonde to
        widespread acclaim. Blonde debuted at number one in several countries,
        including the United States and the United Kingdom, and recorded sales
        of 232,000 copies (275,000 with album-equivalent units) in its first
        week.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than going on a typical promotional tour playing radio festivals
        and appearing on television shows, Ocean spent a month after the release
        of Blonde, traveling to countries such as China, Japan and France. He
        also chose not to submit Blonde for consideration at the Grammy Awards,
        stating "that institution certainly has nostalgic importance; it just
        doesn't seem to be representing very well for people who come from where
        I come from, and hold down what I hold down." Time ranked it as the best
        album of 2016 on its year-end list. Forbes estimated that Blonde earned
        Ocean nearly one million in profits after one week of availability,
        attributing this to him releasing the album independently and as a
        limited exclusive release on iTunes and Apple Music. On July 9, 2018,
        Blonde was certified platinum by the RIAA.
